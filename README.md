# PokerStars_Advisor
A real-time computer vision–based decision system designed to analyze online poker gameplay directly from live screen captures and provide Game Theory Optimal (GTO) strategy recommendations.
The proposed system automatically detects and interprets key visual elements of the poker table, including player cards, community cards, chip stacks, bets, and pot sizes, using a combination of object detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and image segmentation techniques. These extracted features are dynamically integrated to reconstruct the full game state in real time. A GTO solver module then evaluates the reconstructed state and computes optimal actions such as fold, call, or raise, along with corresponding bet sizes.
